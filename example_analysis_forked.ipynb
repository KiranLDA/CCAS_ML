    "# OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding group decision-making in mobile species is a complex challenge. The integration of both GPS and acoustic sensors into tags deployed on multiple individuals in groups can help us systematically quantify communication between individuals as well as their movement responses - based on who is calling, the context of the call, and how the group reacts. However, the resulting datasets are very large, and the manual identification and classification of calls is both time and labor consuming. \n",

    "\n",
    "This code interfaces with a supervised machine learning tool for detecting call presence and/or call type in field recordings. We train a convolutional neural network to extract features from spectrograms. Bidirectional gated recurrent units learned temporal structure from these features, and a final feed-forward network predicted call type. We also used data augmentation to increase the number of training examples for underrepresented call types. We illustrate the method on bio-logging data from meerkat groups, where all individuals in the group were equipped with acoustic loggers. \n",
