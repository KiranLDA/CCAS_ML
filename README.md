# Coordination and Communication Across Scales (CCAS)

This code runs in python. At the moment, for development purposes, the main code is stored in full_analysis_meerkat.py. This bit of code takes wav data from meerkat collars and matches these audio recodring with labelled data (start, stop, calltype - audition file) to train an RNN. Once the RNN is trained, it then predicts on a test set, and evaluates model outputs.


#Note that this is still under development
